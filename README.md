# This is a simple React Js Assignment

# Project Definition
It is said that all people on average are six, or fewer, social connections away from each other.
This app that helps to find the degree of separation between any two people.
Think of it as selecting two users on Facebook and trying to see how these two people are
connected.

## In the app...
1. We can add new users
2. Find out degree of separation between any two people in the app.

Default Users data: \

I have used session storage for storing users data and used depth first search for finding least degree of separation.

### Degree of separation
For example: \
If you select two people, letâ€™s say rahul and dhruv, the application will show the degree
of separation as follows. \
rahul => sai => dhruv
